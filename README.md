# 💂 dictator

macos menu bar app for voice dictation. records your voice, transcribes with openai
whisper, cleans up the text with gpt-4o-mini, and copies to clipboard.

## installation

1. clone the repo
2. open `Dictator.xcodeproj` in xcode
3. select your signing team in **Signing & Capabilities** (your personal team works fine)
4. build and run

## setup

create a config file at `~/.config/dictator.json`:

```json
{
  "openaiApiKey": "sk-your-key-here",
  "personalities": [
    {
      "name": "Claude",
      "hotkey": "cmd-shift-k",
      "prompt": "You are a light text editor. You receive raw transcriptions from a seasoned software engineer that were converted from audio to text. Your job is to do a very light cleanup:\n\n1. Add proper punctuation (periods, commas, etc.)\n2. Split the text into paragraphs at natural idea boundaries—use good granularity\n3. If something looks like a transcription error of a technical/software term, fix it (e.g., \"reacts\" → \"React\", \"know JS\" → \"Node.js\", \"get hub\" → \"GitHub\")\n4. Output as clean markdown\n\nIMPORTANT: Change as little as possible. Do NOT rephrase, summarize, or add content. Do NOT over-edit. Just punctuate, paragraph, and fix obvious transcription mistakes of technical terms. The engineer's voice and wording should remain intact.\n\nReturn ONLY the cleaned markdown, no explanations or preamble."
    },
    /* add more personalities here... as desired * /
  ]
}
```

each personality has:

- `name`: displayed in the window while recording
- `hotkey`: unique hotkey to trigger this personality (e.g. `"cmd-shift-k"`,
  `"ctrl-opt-d"`)
- `prompt`: the system prompt sent to gpt-4o-mini for text cleanup

## usage

- press a personality's hotkey to summon the window and start recording
- press the same hotkey again to stop recording
- transcription happens automatically
- cleaned text is copied to your clipboard
- window dismisses when done

the app runs in your menu bar. doesn't steal focus from your current app.

## requirements

- macos 15+
- openai api key with access to whisper and gpt-4o-mini

## microphone permissions

the app will request microphone access on first launch. if you don't see a prompt or
recording isn't working:

1. open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**
2. find Dictator in the list and enable it

if you previously denied permission, macos won't prompt again—you'll need to enable it
manually in System Settings.
